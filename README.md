# Left Rank algorithm

### 1. Introduction

Repository that contains the Python file for the Left Rotation algorithm from HackerRank.
This algorithm allows the user to shift the positions of the elements inside of a string.

### 2. How to run the algorithm ?

To run the algorithm, you must go to your terminal and use the following command below :

python -m input_string number_of_left_rotation

Parameters :
-  input_string; type = string : the string for which we want to left rotate its elements.
-  number_of_left_rotation; type = int : number of left rotate we want to do.

### 3. Contents of the repository

-  LeftRotation.py : Python file that contains the code to do the left rotation.
-  main.py : Python file that allows to run the left rotation from the terminal.
